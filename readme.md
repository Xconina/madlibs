Mad Libs Generator

This Mad Libs has two files. Both files contain 3 different mad lib stories. 
You will select a story. In the madlibs.py, you will type in a number 1-3 to select a story. 
In the madlibsgui, you will use a menu with buttons set up with Tkinter to select a story. 
After choosing a story, you will input nouns, adjectives, verbs, etc. 
The program will then add these words and display what the story now says. 
In the madlibsgui.py, you will be able to select additional stories. In the other, you would rerun the program.
