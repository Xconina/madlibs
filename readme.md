# Mad Libs Generator

This Mad Libs has three files. All three files contain the same 3 different mad lib stories. Mad libs are stories that you fill-in-the-blank with random nouns, verbs, adjectives, etc. I have written the stories and formatted the program three different ways to practice different techniques and approaches.
## Madlibs.py Usage
```python
select a story

Prompted to enter a noun, verb, etc
input word

After complete, program will output story with your words filled in
```

## Madlibsgui.py Usage

```python
includes a GUI made with tkinter

use a menu to select story

then continue same as first program.

#You are able to select more stories after finishing one
```
## Madlibsdict.py

```python
This is the same as madlibsgui.py except:
    instead of x = input("")
    it is formatted with a dictionary

#the keys are listed 
#then program will iterate through keys to get values

the program will then run as normal
